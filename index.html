      <h2>So what is a chimera?</h2>
      <p>
        The name comes from Greek mythology. The Chimera was a fearsome, fire-breathing creature
        with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a dragon's tail, essentially a being amalgamated from different species.

        From a scientific standpoint, a chimera is an organism whose cells are derived from two or more zygotes.
        During the embryonic phase, the cell cumuli that would eventually form two different beings
        could fuse forming a single zigot containing the DNA genome of both offspring. Eventually, a new
        organism would form containing tissues from both zigots.

      <h2>How were chimeras discovered?</h2>
      <p>
        The first was a case of a woman, Karen, who was told, following DNA tests of family members for a kidney donor, that two
        of her three sons could not be hers. Similar cases were later reported where the main tissues in the individuals' bodies
        possessed an "X" DNA sequence, while the reproductive organs were made up of "Y" DNA strands.

      <h2>And are there any risks?</h2>
      <p>
        When speaking about artifical chimeras, scientists are also able to create such individuals
        by combining the DNA of different species. Recently, a pig-human chimera was created to run
        medical tests with a higher accuracy in terms of results.

        As it would be expected, these research trials could eventually lead to the creation of
        individuals with merged human and animal DNA. Can you imagine what animals with human brain
        tissue would be capable of?
